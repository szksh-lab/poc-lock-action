      # :x: Failed to merge the pull request as the deploy to {{.Vars.target}} is locked

      {{template "link" .}}

      The deploy is being locked now.
      This means a deploy is being run on the default branch.
      Please wait until the deploy is finished and try to merge again.

      If no deploy is run but the deploy is locked, this means the lock wasn't unlocked properly.
      In this case, please contact maintainers.
